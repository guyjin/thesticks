So, the thing you need to understand about all of this is that this never started out to be a thing.  Really.  Honest.  Would I lie to you?

What it really is is a way to tell bedtime stories to my kids without having to figure everything out fresh every night.  Call it a storytime framework.  A bedtime madlibs if you will. (Which I will.)

What it's ended up being is a small universe of fairly remarkable ficticious people that just so happen to be a pretty nice bunch.
