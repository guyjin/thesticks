The Sticks has a small number of characters.  It' easier to to tell the stories when we don't have to keep track of a cast of thousands, right?

## Milicent McGillicutty

Milicent is the original resident of the Sticks.  She and her husband, the right respectable Captain McGillicutty moved to the Sticks an unknown number of years ago.  It was a lot though, early enough that as a young bride, Milicent saved an also young Elvis Presley from a mob of fans.  All of Milicent's stories happen without the Captain.  In earlier years, he was usually sailing somewhere exotic.  Later stories happen after his death.  His passing is never spoken of, but it's understood that Milicent has managed her grief.

With the valiant Captain either gone or, *ahem*, Gone, Milicent has been left to her own devices for most of her life.  The house that she and her husband built still stands.  It wears its' years with pride and reflects the sturdy nature of Milicent.  The clapboard siding has grayed with age, and the boards on the front porch are starting to warp, but it's still a strong house.

Milicent drives a very old [pickup truck](../images/milicents_truck.jpg "Milicent's old truck").  Surprisingly it still runs relatively well, dispite its age.  The very loud and very frequent backfiring don't seem to slow Milicent down much.

Milicent lives with her dog Severus.

## Severus the Three Legged Dog

Severus is an old hound dog with three legs.  Severus didn't lose his leg.  He gave it away to Dauchsund that only had two legs.  Severus figured he could get along without it.  Obviously, Severus is a relatively unique dog.

While Severus spends most of his time with Milicent, he does have a lady friend that he shares a dog house with. Her name is Penolope  The dog house is halfway between Milicent's house and the house of Penolope's owner.

## Leonard Beauchamp

Leonard is a very large man.  Don't think fat.  Think LARGE.  Leonard is at least seven feet tall, sometimes appearing even larger depending on the circumstances.  He works as a sheep farmer in the low hills just past the end of the road.

Leonard has a large laugh, a wide ready smile and a strong back paired with a sharp wit.  He wears demin bib overalls and works most days with Penolope on the farm.

Most of the characters that live in The Sticks are somewhat open to interpretation. In my mind, Leonard isn't one of them.  He is very distinct to me.  He has short cut curly brown hair and large callused hands.  He has laugh lines around his eyes and a large(ish) aqualine nose.
