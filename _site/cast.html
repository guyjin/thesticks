<h1>Cast</h1>

<p>The Sticks has a small number of characters.  It' easier to to tell the stories when we don&rsquo;t have to keep track of a cast of thousands, right?</p>

<h2>Milicent McGillicuty</h2>

<p>Milicent is the original resident of the Sticks.  She and her husband, the right respectable Captain McGillicutty moved to the Sticks an unknown number of years ago.  It was a lot though, early enough that as a young bride, Milicent saved an also young Elvis Presley from a mob of fans.  All of Milicent&rsquo;s stories happen without the Captain.  In earlier years, he was usually sailing somewhere exotic.  Later stories happen after his death.  His passing is never spoken of, but it&rsquo;s understood that Milicent has managed her grief.</p>

<p>With the valiant Captain either gone or, <em>ahem</em>, Gone, Milicent has been left to her own devices for most of her life.  The house that she and her husband built still stands.  It wears its' years with pride and reflects the sturdy nature of Milicent.  The clapboard siding has grayed with age, and the boards on the front porch are starting to warp, but it&rsquo;s still a strong house.</p>

<p>Milicent drives a very old <a href="images/milicents_truck.jpg" title="Milicent's old truck">pickup truck</a>.  Surprisingly it still runs relatively well, dispite its age.  The very loud and very frequent backfiring don&rsquo;t seem to slow Milicent down much.</p>

<p>Milicent lives in her house with her dog Severus.</p>
