{"name":"Thesticks","tagline":"Just some stories I've told my kids.","body":"#The Sticks\r\n\r\nSo, the thing you need to understand about all of this is that this never started out to be a thing.  Really.  Honest.  Would I lie to you?\r\n\r\nWhat it really is, why I came up with it, is a way to tell bedtime stories to my kids without having to figure everything out fresh every night.  Call it a storytime framework.  A bedtime madlibs if you will. (Which I will.)\r\n\r\nWhat it's ended up being is a small universe of fairly remarkable ficticious people that just so happen to be a pretty nice bunch.\r\n\r\n##Location, location, location\r\n\r\nThe Sticks is small dirt road on the other side of a mountain pass from the town.  The town doesn't have a name and it's location has never appeared in a story.  The name isn't important.  The point is that there's a small friendly town over the hill.\r\n\r\nThe pass is a dirt road as well, and subject to closure at the whim of the weather, which makes for a great winter snow day or Christmas story.\r\n\r\nThe Sticks itself is a small country lane, just off the main road from the pass where it finally levels out after leaving the mountains.  On one side of it is an empty meadow.  During the summer it's full of sunflowers, bumblebees and wildflowers.  In the winter the snow drifts in it , building up tiny mountain ranges that shift from day to day.  \r\n\r\nThe lane begins to bend to the right after about 2/3's of a mile, where the curve begins the woods come down to meet the meadow.  It's a beautiful, sunny forest, just perfect for adventures.\r\n\r\n##Home sweet home\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the lane, opposite the meadow are three homes.  All of these houses were built at different times and perfectly reflect their occupants.  Further up the lane, where it curls backs and begins winding it's way among the hills is another rather large home that sits on top of one of the hills.\r\n\r\nAlmost perfectly between the last of the three homes and the hilltop house is a sturdy doghouse that sits alongside a worn trail leading between both of the homes.\r\n\r\n* The first house, sitting closest to the main road is a very normal house.  Like any you might find in the suburbs.  It's location in The Sticks is the only exceptional thing about it.  Two stories, two car garage and toys in the yard.  This is house is exactly as it appears.\r\n\r\n* The second home is much more interesting.  An ultra modern ranch style home with beautiful materials, lots of glass and gorgeous landscaping.  This house is sophisticated and has been built with great care.  There is a three car garage be we never see any cars parked in front of it.  If we look closer we can begin to see evidence of a family there: a pair of shoes by the front door, a football left in the rocks beside the house. The evidence is there but there seems to be an air of distraction.\r\nBehind the house is a worn trail that runs out of the backyard and up towards a lone mountain that sits directly behind the house.\r\n\r\n* The third house has been in The Sticks the longest.  It was built many years ago, and while still sturdy, is showing it's age.  The house is all wood, with fading siding, a wrap around porch, and a carport instead of a garage.  We can see an unrestored 1956 Chevrolet pickup parked in the carport.  The paint is faded and there are rust spots, but we can tell it used to be blue. It obviously still runs and gets used regularly. The house has a warm inviting appearance.  It seems to smile and wave to us, but we can tell it's a very old house and seems somewhat melancholy.\r\n\r\n##Time\r\n\r\nThe Sticks exists without a fixed time frame.  Some stories happen in the past, some in the future, but sometime within the current decade.  It really doesn't matter.  Let's call it TimeX.  \r\n\r\n##Who's who\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of people living in The Sticks.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
